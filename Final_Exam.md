## Introduction

I worked on a dataset containing all matches played in the EPL starting from season 2001 to season 2014. For each match, the home/away team, home/away score, home/away scorers, and the time of scoring have been stored in the dataset. Below, you can see a scheme from the raw dataset. In the column `Home Scorers` and `Away Scorers`, `g` is used to indicate a goal, also `og` and `pen` are used to indicate own goal and penalty.
